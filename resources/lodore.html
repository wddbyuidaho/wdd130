    <h1>The Cataract of Lodore</h1>
    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif">BY ROBERT SOUTHEY</h2>
    <p>
      "How does the water Come down at Lodore?" My little boy asked me Thus,
      once on a time; And moreover he tasked me To tell him in rhyme. Anon, at
      the word, There first came one daughter, And then came another, To second
      and third The request of their brother, And to hear how the water Comes
      down at Lodore, With its rush and its roar, As many a time They had seen
      it before. So I told them in rhyme, For of rhymes I had store; And 'twas
      in my vocation For their recreation That so I should sing; Because I was
      Laureate To them and the King.

      From its sources which well In the tarn on the fell; From its fountains In
      the mountains, Its rills and its gills; Through moss and through brake, It
      runs and it creeps For a while, till it sleeps In its own little lake. And
      thence at departing, Awakening and starting, It runs through the reeds,
      And away it proceeds, Through meadow and glade, In sun and in shade, And
      through the wood-shelter, Among crags in its flurry, Helter-skelter,
      Hurry-skurry. Here it comes sparkling, And there it lies darkling; Now
      smoking and frothing Its tumult and wrath in, Till, in this rapid race On
      which it is bent, It reaches the place Of its steep descent.
    </p>

    <p>The cataract strong Then plunges along, Striking and raging</p>

    <p>
      As if a war waging Its caverns and rocks among; Rising and leaping,
      Sinking and creeping, Swelling and sweeping, Showering and springing,
      Flying and flinging, Writhing and ringing, Eddying and whisking, Spouting
      and frisking, Turning and twisting, Around and around With endless
      rebound: Smiting and fighting, A sight to delight in; Confounding,
      astounding, Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collecting, projecting, Receding and speeding, And shocking and rocking,
      And darting and parting, And threading and spreading, And whizzing and
      hissing, And dripping and skipping, And hitting and splitting, And shining
      and twining, And rattling and battling, And shaking and quaking, And
      pouring and roaring, And waving and raving, And tossing and crossing, And
      flowing and going, And running and stunning, And foaming and roaming, And
      dinning and spinning, And dropping and hopping, And working and jerking,
      And guggling and struggling, And heaving and cleaving, And moaning and
      groaning;
    </p>

    <p>
      And glittering and frittering, And gathering and feathering, And whitening
      and brightening, And quivering and shivering, And hurrying and skurrying,
      And thundering and floundering;
    </p>

    <p>
      Dividing and gliding and sliding, And falling and brawling and sprawling,
      And driving and riving and striving, And sprinkling and twinkling and
      wrinkling, And sounding and bounding and rounding, And bubbling and
      troubling and doubling, And grumbling and rumbling and tumbling, And
      clattering and battering and shattering;
