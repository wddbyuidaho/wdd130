            <p>One of the goals of this course is to introduce you to many of the different career options available in Web
                Design and Development. The first we will learn about is that of Frontend Developer.</p>
            <p>Watch this great introduction to this career by Treehouse. It introduces the type of work you would be doing,
                along with the skills you would need to succeed. It will also review many of the concepts we have already
                been learning in the course.</p>
            <p>You may also want to take a few notes. There will be an assignment later in the semester where I will ask
                you to reflect on what you have learned about careers in Web design and Development.</p>
