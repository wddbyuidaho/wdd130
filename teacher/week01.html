        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is from a great set of exercises from
          Wes Bos
          <a href="https://javascript30.com" target="_blank">Javascript30</a>.
          It is lesson 4: Array Cardio I. It does a great job of getting the
          students in and using the array methods. The readings introduce DOM
          manipulation and Events.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again with the readings, encourage them also to look to other sources
          when things don't make sense. The book does a pretty good job, but the
          way it addresses some topics might be confusing to some students. Help
          them to remember that there are other options. Several are listed in
          this weeks reading in fact. The notes they turn in do not have to be
          all from the assigned readings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          For your meeting with them give an example of building some dynamic
          DOM and add some events. For the events portion you may consider
          assigning another lesson from the Javascript30 course or reviewing the
          concepts from it:
          <a href="https://javascript30.com" target="_blank"
            >25: Event Capture, Propagation...</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might then do something like this
          <a href="../examples/hiking-complete.html" target="_blank"
            >dynamically built list of hikes</a
          >. (Here is a link to
          <a href="hiking-complete.html" target="_blank"
            >just the html and css</a
          >
          you could provide as a starting point to the students.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will probably not have time to do this entire demo (pulling up a
          detailed view of a hike when a summary list view hike is
          touched)....which is fine since the last part is revisited in the Week
          5 team activity. The important part is to show how to create DOM
          elements from a data source...and show some examples of using events.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also a good time to talk about issues that may arise from
          javascript executing before the DOM is loaded. Talk about ways to
          avoid those problems (onload listener, adding the script at the bottom
          of the body, or using the <code>defer</code> flag on your script
          element)
