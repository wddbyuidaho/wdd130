        <h2><strong>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</strong></h2>

        <p>Estimated Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>
          One of our goals for this class is to allow you to create a real
          website accessible with a browser.&nbsp; This, as you will discover in
          the readings and videos for this week, requires you to have what is
          known as a host.&nbsp; Most hosts cost money, but not all.&nbsp; For
          this class, we will be using a free service called
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://glitch.com"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Glitch.com</a
            ></strong
          >. Using this service allows you to create your website with their
          text editor, save the website, upload the images for the website, and
          even share the website with an instructor or fellow student for
          collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few steps we will need to go through to get everything set
          up so you are ready to begin..

            <h2>Glitch Login</h2>
            <p>
              Visit the
              <a

                >Glitch</a
              >
              website and click on the <strong>Sign in</strong> button in the
              top right corner of the screen. Glitch lets you sign in using
              either Facebook, Google, email, or GitHub (I like GitHub and use
              that one)... all are free to use. (If you choose to use GitHub,
              you would need to have a github account). Click on the Sign in
              button for the account you would like to use. You may see a screen
              requesting permission for Glitch to access the account you have
              chosen to use.

            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If you choose email sign in we recommend
                <strong>NOT</strong> using your BYUI.edu email. Glitch will send
                you a verification email...the BYUI system is currently stopping
                that email so you can't verify. This will cause you problems
                later.

            <h2>Remix (copy) the starter project</h2>
            <p>
              Next we need to create a&nbsp;project for you to use this
              semester. Glitch gives you the ability to use an existing project
              as a starting point. After logging in to Glitch, visit
              <a
                href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wdd130-starter"
                target="_blank"
                >this project</a
              >
              and click on the "Remix to Edit" button on
              the screen. This will create a copy of the project that you own
              and can edit. This is where we will be doing much of our work for
              the class.

            <h2>Become familiar with the interface</h2>
            <p>
              After creating a project you should see something similar to the
              following:
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Glitch editor"
                  src="../images/glitch-project-tour.jpeg"
                  title="Glitch editor"
                />
                <figcaption>Create a New Project</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li>
                This is the random name that Glitch chose for your project. You
                can change this by clicking on the name. You will also find
                settings that effect the editor (changing theme, wrap text, etc)
                in here. Checking the "Wrap Text" box is recommended.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is the list of files in the project. Notice that
                <kbd>index.html</kbd> is selected and open in the editor. The
                <kbd>README.md</kbd> file contains information about the
                different files in the project. Click on the filename to open it
                in the editor and spend a few minutes reading through that.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is the code editor. It is where we will spend most of our
                time writing HTML and CSS
              </li>
              <li>
                This is where you will click to preview your page. It will
                either open a new tab or a new pane next to the editor where you
                can see the results of the code you write.
              </li>
              <li>This is where you can add a new file to your project.</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Review the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file</h2>
            <p>
              The HTML code that is currently in the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file
              should look similar to below:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;WDD 130&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- logo will go here --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="exercises/site-plan.html"&gt;Site Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
                    </code></pre>

            <p>
              It's ok if this doesn't make sense yet. We will eventually learn
              about what each line in this code does. For now let's take a look
              at the page this code created. Make sure that the
              <kbd>index.html</kbd> file is selected in the list of files and
              click on the "Show" button. You should see a very basic page with
              only three links.
            </p>

            <h2>Glitch Settings</h2>
            <p>
              Let's make one more change to the Glitch settings. In the top
              right corner of the screen there are two icons. The far right one
              let's you see some information about Glitch...it usually looks
              like a fish. The other is for some User options. Click on that
              one. You should see something similar to the image below. Uncheck
              "Refresh App", and check "Wrap Text"
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Glitch settings"
                  src="../images/glitch-settings.png"
                  title="Glitch settings"

              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              You can also change Glitch to use a dark theme instead of the
              light one from that menu as well if you prefer that.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              Let's practice writing a little HTML of our own now. Visit the
              <a href="aboutme.html">Getting to know you activity</a> for the
              rest of the instructions and requirements for this activity.

        <h2><strong>Other Software</strong></h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Here is a list of other software we will use this semester. These
            are all web based and require no installation. Some would require
            account creation. Your instructor will give you more details when it
            is time to use them:
