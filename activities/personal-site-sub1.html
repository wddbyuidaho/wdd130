        <p>
          Last week you should have gotten all most of the styling for your Home
          page done. This week we will style the first Child page.
        </p>

        <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
        <ol class="bigSteps">

            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Open the file</h3>
            <p>Open the file for your first sub page.</p>
            <!-- <p>
              Create a new HTML file for your child page. Name it something
              short and that relates to what the page is. Remember to avoid
              spaces and capitals in your name. You may want to then Copy/paste
              the contents of your Home page into this new file, replacing what
              was there. Then remove the Home page specific content (usually the
              contents of <code>main</code>).
            </p> -->

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Child Page Grid</h3>
            <p>
              Open the wireframe for your first child page. We need to build the
              Grid for your layout. From the wireframe determine how many
              columns and rows you will need. Then create those with CSS. Then
              start placing your elements into the grid cells.
            </p>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Spacing and Alignment</h3>
            <p>
              Add padding and margins where appropriate to give your layout the
              right amount of white-space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adjust the alignment of elements as well at this time as needed.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Link it up</h3>
            <p>
              Make sure to update the navigation in both your Home page and the
              child page so that if you click on a link in either page it will
              take you to the other.
            </p>

                Note that this week only the first child page is expected to be
                complete. You will need to follow the steps above for the second
                child page as well, but it is due with the completed site next
                week.
