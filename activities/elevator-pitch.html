          <p>So What is an Elevator pitch anyway?</p>
          <p>
            An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech that you can use to
            spark interest in what you or your organization does. You can also
            use one to create interest in a project, idea, or product.
          </p>
          <p>It needs to be succinct, while conveying important information.</p>

          The Final project for this class will be for you to create a website
          on a topic of your choice. We will start building this personal site
          in Week 10. In order to prepare for that we need to start planning
          now. Over the next few weeks as we continue learning more CSS and
          finish the Rafting site we will also be preparing a Site Plan for our
          final personal site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step in the planning process is to determine the purpose of
          the site, so this week you need to settle on your idea for what you
          want to do. You should then create an elevator pitch for your personal
          site idea. Creating an elevator pitch can be a good gauge of the
          quality of your ideas and your enthusiasm for them.

            <dl class="def-list">
              <dt>Concise</dt>
              <dd>
                An effective elevator pitch contains as few words as possible,
                but no fewer.
              </dd>
              <dt>Clear</dt>
              <dd>
                Rather than being filled with acronyms, MBA-speak, and
                ten-dollar words, an effective elevator pitch can be understood
                by your grandparents, your spouse, and your children.
              </dd>

              <dt>Compelling</dt>
              <dd>
                An effective elevator pitch explains the problem your Solution
                solves.
              </dd>
              <dt>Credible</dt>
              <dd>
                An effective elevator pitch explains why you are qualified to
                see the problem and to build your Solution.
              </dd>
              <dt>Conceptual</dt>
              <dd>
                An effective elevator pitch stays at a fairly high level and
                does not go into too much unnecessary detail.
              </dd>
              <dt>Concrete</dt>
              <dd>
                As much as is possible, an effective elevator pitch is also
                specific and tangible.
              </dd>
              <dt>Customized</dt>
              <dd>
                An effective elevator pitch addresses the specific interests and
                concerns of the audience.
              </dd>
              <dt>Consistent</dt>
              <dd>
                Every version of an effective elevator pitch conveys the same
                basic message.
              </dd>
              <dt>Conversational</dt>
              <dd>
                Rather than being to close the deal, the goal of an elevator
                pitch is to just set the hook; to start a conversation, or
                dialogue, with the audience.

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p>
              Consider the following examples. Can you see the application of
              the 9C's in them?
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“I work with Computers”</li>
              <li>“I’m a computer programmer”</li>
              <li>“I make mobile applications”</li>
              <li>
                "My company writes mobile device applications for other
                businesses."
              </li>
              <li>
                "My company develops mobile applications that businesses use to
                train their staff remotely. This results in a big increase in
                efficiency for an organization's managers."
              </li>
              <li>
                "Think about the last online purchase you made. Did you need any
                instructions to do it? Did everything go smoothly? That’s what I
                do… I make websites and online storefronts that look great and
                are so intuitive to use that people don’t need instructions or
                training to use them. I do this for a wide variety of
                businesses."
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Create a pitch for your website idea.</h3>
            <p>
              Create a 75-150 word pitch (about 60 seconds worth) for an idea
              that you would like to turn into a website. You can use the
              following process to help:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify your idea or goal.</li>
              <li>Explain what you want the website to do.</li>
              <li>Communicate your USP. (Unique Selling proposition)</li>
              <li>Engage with a question</li>
              <li>Put it all together.</li>
              <li>Practice!</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- END STEP  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Publish</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have put your pitch together and
              <strong>practiced</strong> it, share it with 3-4 people and get
              their feedback. These people can be anyone you think will give
              good feedback to you, but this sharing must be done synchronously!
              (face to face or video conference ideally). After sharing and
              getting feedback post your pitch and the feedback to the Elevator
              Pitch assignment.
