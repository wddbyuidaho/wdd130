        <hr />

        <p>
          The first task we have with our personal site, just like we had with
          the Dry Oar site, is to get the content organized with HTML. This week
          our goal is to get the HTML written and all of the content inserted
          for all three pages of our site.
        </p>

        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Home Page wireframe</h3>
            <p>
              Open the wireframe for your homepage first. You may even want to
              print it out and grab a marker and a ruler. We need to visualize
              any groups of content on the page and draw boxes around the
              groups. Each of these boxes should be represented as HTML in our
              page. <kbd>div, section, main, header, footer, nav</kbd>, etc
              elements should be used for this purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file in your personal project in
              Glitch for your home page.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Home Page HTML and Content</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have identified any content groups on your wireframe,
              begin at the top left corner and start adding the elements
              necessary, then add the content for the home page.
            </p>
            <p>Add a link to your siteplan to the footer of the Home page.</p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Continue for page 2 and 3</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have the home page done, do the same exercise for pages
              two and three. The header and footer code should be very similar
              if not identical to the home page. Most of your changes should
              happen in the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should create a new html file for each page. Name them with
              something meaningful (but without any spaces or capitalization).
              You may even want to copy/paste the HTML from your
              <kbd>index.html</kbd> file as a starting point for these child
              pages. Just remember that while you will want to keep the code in
              the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> (since it should be the same across
              all three pages) you should clear out the
              <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element when starting each new child
              page.
