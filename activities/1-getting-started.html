                <p>
                  There are a few things to keep in mind as you come up with
                  names for the files and folders that will make up your
                  website.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Always name the first page of your site&nbsp;
                    <kbd>index.html</kbd>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Most web hosts are&nbsp; <em>case-sensitive</em>&nbsp;which
                    means there is a difference between&nbsp;
                    <kbd> <span class="highlight">I</span>ndex.html</kbd
                    >&nbsp;and&nbsp; <kbd>index.html</kbd>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    So...Make your filenames all lowercase to avoid problems
                    with case sensitivity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Avoid spaces and other special characters in your filenames
                    (a-z, 0-9, -, and _ are all safe to use)
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <h3 id="step2">Inspect the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></h3>
              <p>
                If you look at the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your
                <kbd>index.html</kbd> file you will notice a couple of lines
                that were not in the <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> page that we
                completed earlier. One of them should look familiar from the
                Khan Academy lesson: <kbd>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</kbd>.
                The other is new.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meta tags give the browser information to help it build the web
                page. They are always found in the&nbsp;
                <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;with the other information that is
                for the browser only. The <kbd>charset</kbd> meta gives
                information that helps the browser to know which characters it
                will be expected to render. English for example has a very
                simple character set. It lacks the characters to list anything
                in Russian for example. Our <kbd>charset</kbd> line tells the
                browser to use a universal set of characters instead of the
                default (depends on your computer).
              </p>
              <p>
                The <kbd>viewport</kbd> meta tag makes the page aware of how
                wide the browser window currently is. This is very important in
                this day of different screen sizes.
              </p>

            <li>
              <h3 id="step3">Change the title</h3>
              <p>
                Let's go ahead and change the title next. The
                <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the page shows at the top of the
                browser window or on the tab of a browser window, and in the
                search listing for a site. Let's pick something that will make
                sure people know what the site is, and what page they are
                currently on. Something like "Whitewater Rafting Vacations | Dry
                Oar Boating | Home".
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  We know from the&nbsp;
                  <a href="../images/wireframe-grid-boxes.png" target="_blank"
                    >wireframe</a
                  >&nbsp;for the home page for the Dry Oar site that there will
                  be a combination of images, headlines, and text on the page.
                  The Khan academy lesson for this week taught you how to add
                  all of those things to a page with HTML. You will need to
                  refer back to your wireframe and site plan document throughout
                  this activity to make sure you don't forget anything on the
                  home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you look at the wireframe you will notice a few things.
                  First a box with an X through it indicates an image will go
                  there. A shaded box around something indicates that it should
                  be colored. The numbers that are in the corners of some of the
                  boxes indicate sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The wireframe also indicates where our headlines and
                  paragraphs will be, and should show approximately how much
                  space the text should take up, and the relative sizes of the
                  headlines and paragraph text. It also helps us to see the
                  organization of the page. Elements are organized into groups.
                  It will be important that we include html markup to represent
                  those groups, as well as to get the content on the page.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="callout">
                <h3>Note!</h3>
                <p>
                  We will <strong>NOT</strong> be adding colors and other styles
                  this week. Our only goal is to get all of the content onto the
                  page that is shown on the wireframe. Our Page will
                  <strong>NOT</strong> look like the wireframe when we finish
                  this week. Each week will get us closer, but our page will not
                  look exactly like the wireframe for several weeks, so patience
                  will be required :)

              <h3 id="step4">"Framing" with semantic elements</h3>
              <p>
                Building a website is actually a lot like building a house. You
                start with a blueprint (wireframe) and then you build the
                foundation and frame for the house. We have already built the
                foundation. We did that when we added the
                <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements above. The framing takes the
                rooms outlined on the blueprint and creates a real space to put
                them. We need to do the same thing for our webpage, except for
                instead of rooms we are looking at content areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The way we "frame" in our webpage is by looking carefully at our
                wireframe to see what "rooms" we have. Then we use some special
                HTML tags to define them.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Take a moment to review the
                  <a href="../images/wireframe-grid-boxes.png" target="_blank"
                    >wireframe</a
                  >
                  again to help remember what we are trying to do. Remember that
                  I mentioned above that we are looking right now at content
                  areas...elements on the page that are related and grouped. The
                  wireframe has colored boxes to help you to see those
                  relationships. We need to add some markup to create those
                  containers in our html.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Html has several tags specifically for this purpose. Some have
                  specific semantic meanings and others don't. We should always
                  try and use the ones with meaning whenever we can. Here is a
                  list of some of the more common of these tags:&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,&nbsp; <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
                  <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>,&nbsp; <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
                  and&nbsp; <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Last week you were asked to review a short article on
                  <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp"

                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >HTML Semantics </a
                  >. There is a chart there that does a nice job of showing how
                  those elements might be used in a simple site layout. Take a
                  minute to go check it out again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of these elements behave the same in the browser except
                  for&nbsp; <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, but they are used to show
                  different sections of the page. Try to use the more specific
                  ones first, using a generic&nbsp;
                  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;only if none of the others seems
                  to apply to the content you are boxing in.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Add HTML elements to your body to start outlining content areas.
                The first we need is at the top of the page. Notice that there
                is a box around the logo and navigation bar. Those elements are
                related and form the header of the page. Lucky for us if you
                look in the list of tags above you will see that there is a
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag! Not only that but the starter
                code already has one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside of the header you can see a second box around the links
                for the navigation. Again after reviewing the list above we see
                a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag...perfect! And again it looks
                like the instructor was a little too generous with the starter
                code because you already have one!
              </p>
              <p>
                Next let's add an area where the main content for this page will
                go. On a normal site the header and footer will stay the same
                across pages...but the central content will change from page to
                page. We need a box to hold that. The
                <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag was built for just this use. Add a
                <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element to your page right below the
                <code>&lt;/header&gt;</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                The first thing we need inside our new
                <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is a banner image that will
                stretch all the way across the screen. Let's add some html to
                hold that. In this case a simple <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> is
                probably the right answer.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <h4>Tip!</h4>
                <p>
                  There will be a lot of code examples in this and other
                  lessons. Avoid the temptation to just copy/paste them into
                  your page. Type them out! This might seem like a bother, but
                  you will remember the HTML and CSS we use much better if you
                  do ;)
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Below that banner is a bunch of content. It is separate from the
                banner, but related. Let's use an HTML element to group the
                content in that section together. Another
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> would work well again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notice that the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s we created for the
                banner and the rest of the main content look just the same! We
                need a way to distinguish between the two elements. The common
                way to do this in HTML is with a <kbd>class</kbd> or
                <kbd>id</kbd> attribute. Lets add unique classes to each of
                those divs that describe what will be inside them. For example
                for the banner lets add <kbd>class="banner-box"</kbd> and for
                the rest of the content add <kbd>class="home-grid"</kbd> (this
                name will make more sense later).
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally we need one more container on our page. This one will
                hold the footer information. Again if you refer to the list of
                semantic elements above you will see a
                <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element. Add one below
                <code>&lt;/main&gt;</code>.
              </p>

              <p>At this point my <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> looks like this:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;div class="logo-box"&gt;&lt;!-- logo will go here --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt; 
            &lt;!-- navigation here --&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="site-plan.html"&gt;Site Plan"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;div class="banner-box"&gt; &lt;!-- banner image will go here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="home-grid"&gt; &lt;!-- the rest of the main content will go here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt; &lt;!-- footer info here --&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

                  You may have noticed the lines in my code above that are in
                  grey. They are called comments...notes to yourself that the
                  browser will ignore. Comments start with &lt;!-- and end with
                  --&gt; and everything in-between will be ignored. Comments are
                  a great way to remind yourself what you were thinking when you

                        You can have Google help you try to avoid those and find
                        images that are free to use by searching something like
                        <kbd>rafting</kbd> in Google...then select the
                        <kbd>Images</kbd> tab. At the top of the screen you will
                        see a <kbd>Settings</kbd> option. Select
                        <kbd>Advanced Search</kbd>. Towards the bottom of that
                        page is a <kbd>Usage Rights</kbd> option. Select "free

              <h3 id="step5">Header content</h3>
              <p>
                Let's work on the header first. Visit the image links above and
                find the logo you would like to use. Add the
                <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag to your page inside the&nbsp;
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. Remember that the&nbsp;
                <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag has 2 required
                attributes.&nbsp; <kbd>alt</kbd>&nbsp;and&nbsp; <kbd>src</kbd>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <kbd>src</kbd> should indicate the location of the image and
                <kbd>alt=""</kbd>&nbsp;should contain a short description about
                the image and is used primarily for the screen readers that the
                visually impaired use to browse the web.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                This image is already the right size and is on a web server, so
                we just need to figure out what its URL is to add it to our
                page. Your browser makes it really easy to do that. If you click
                with the right mouse button on any image in the browser your
                computer will offer you several actions you can take. The one we
                are interested in right now is "Copy Image Address".
              </p>
              <p>
                Copy the address for the logo image and paste the result into
                the src attribute in our image. the final tag should look
                something like this:
              </p>

                  You may have noticed something else about my code as well.
                  Notice how I am indenting my HTML elements to help me clearly
                  see which elements are inside of other elements. As your page
                  gets larger this becomes more and more important. Take a
                  little time to keep your code in order...you will be happy you
                  did later on.

              <p>
                Now it's time to add the list of subpages that will eventually
                become links and provide our site's navigation.You may not know the exact name of these pages yet and that's OK.
                They can always be changed later.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Notice that I said 'list' there. One thing most people don't
                realize is that most navigation bars on most websites are made
                with an unordered list...the same one you learned how to use in
                this week's Khan Academy lesson. They are well disguised, but
                they really are lists.
              </p>
              <p>
                The starter code provided already had the start of a list for
                you. Notice the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element with two
                <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> children. Add additional
                <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements for each link that shows in
                your siteplan. I would let the <code>aboutme.html</code> link
                drop to the bottom of the list. The home page, index.html, should always be first in the menu.
              </p>

              <p>
                Your <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> should look something like
                this:
              </p>

              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;header&gt;

   &lt;ul&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       ...the rest of your list...
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="site-plan.html"&gt;Site Plan"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                Next we have a collection of a bunch of headlines paragraphs and

                have that open right?) and read left to right top to bottom to

                of that same <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Give it a class as well.

                love.</kbd

              <p>
                Finally choose another picture from those provided and add it
                after the paragraph. Add a class to it as well of
                <kbd>home-right-img</kbd>
              </p>

              <p>Here is an example of how your code should look:</p>

              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;div class="home-grid"&gt; 
    &lt;h2 class="home-headline-1"&gt;We run Rivers to relax.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="home-paragraph-1"&gt;We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing...  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img class="home-right-img" src="https://brothert.net/dryoar/images/river-evening.jpg" alt="peaceful evening shot of a river"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    
</code></pre>
              <p>
                Check your work to make sure that everything is showing up
                correctly. Then add another headline, paragraph, and image. Make
                sure to use different names for their classes. I would
                recommend:
                <kbd>home-headline-2, home-paragraph-2, home-left-img</kbd>.
                Text for the paragraph is below:
              </p>
              <kbd class="callout"
                >That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all
                things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when
                you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes
                you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even
                more.

              <div class="callout">
                <h4>Using personal images</h4>
                <p>
                  You may be wondering how you might use a picture of your own
                  on a website. It's actually pretty easy. An image needs to be
                  on a webserver in order to be used on a website. Glitch is our
                  webserver, so if you want to add a picture of your own you
                  just need to upload it into Glitch as we did for the About Me
                  activity. You might want to take an early look at the
                  <a href="..//resources/optimizing-images.html" target="_blank"
                    >Optimizing Images</a
                  >
                  activity before you do this though.

              <h3 id="step9">Finishing up the main content</h3>
              <p>
                The next section is a bit different. The headline and paragraph
                there are going to be kept together when we do our layout.
                Whenever you want to move multiple elements together you should
                group them by placing them <em>inside</em> of another element.
                Let's use a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element for this. Add a
                <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> with a class of
                <kbd>home-paragraph-3</kbd> inside and at the bottom of the
                <kbd>.home-grid</kbd> element, then add a headline and paragraph
                inside of that element like we did above. We don't necessarily
                have to add classes to this <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> since we will learn how to find them
                based off of their parent later. But you can add them if you
                would like. Here is the text for the last paragraph:
              </p>
              <kbd class="callout"
                >We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing
                rivers we visit. Check out our trips and let us know which one
                best suits you. We're waiting to hear from you!</kbd
              >
              <p>
                And here is what the HTML for this portion of the page should
                look like.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;section class="home-paragraph-3"&gt; 
    &lt;h2&gt;Come Run with us.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing rivers we visit.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;   
        </code></pre>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- START STEP -->
              <h3>Footer content</h3>
              <p>
                Finally let's add the content to the
                <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. The copyright comes first. Put it
                into the first element that you should have added in your
                <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. To make the copyright symbol we use
                a special code, there are many of these but we will just learn
                this one today: <kbd>&amp;copy;</kbd> Place that right before
                the 20XX so it will look like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 20XX Dry Oar&lt;p&gt;</code></pre>
              <p>
                Let's go ahead and add your name and section as part of the
                footer as well. So the final html for the footer section should
                look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 20XX Dry Oar - FirstName LastName - Section &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre>
              <p>
                Make sure to replace the "XX" with the current year for the
                copyright! We will add the icons for the social media links
                later.

                  <strong>One more reminder!</strong> Our only goal is to get
                  all of the content onto the page that is shown on the

                  page will not look exactly like the wireframe for several
                  weeks, so patience will be required :)
