        <hr />

        <p>
          Just as we did for the Dry Oar site, before we build our personal
          (final) project we need to do some planning. We started this last week
          by preparing our purpose. This week we will begin a Site plan for the
          personal site we want to build that is very similar to the one we
          prepared for Dry Oar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start by creating a new project in Glitch to use for our final
          website. I have a template site you can remix with a blank HTML based
          site plan.
          <a
            href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/personal-site-template?path=README.md:10:0"
            target="_blank"
            >Remix</a
          >
          this site to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you look at the new site plan template you will notice it is very
          similar to the last one. It does have a new section however...Content.
          For the Dry Oar site I provided you with content, you will need to
          generate all of the content (text and media) for your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also be required to create three wireframes. One for each
          page in your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will have some activities designed to help you complete your site
          plan...but much of it you will need to do on your own. The completed
          site plan for your personal site is due at the end of
          <strong>Week 9</strong>. This gives you three weeks to complete it.
          <strong>Don't wait until the beginning of Week 9 to start!</strong>!
        </p>
