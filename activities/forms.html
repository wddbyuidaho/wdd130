        <hr />

        <p>
          Forms in HTML are a very important topic. They provide the primary
          means to get input back from the users of our sites. Functional forms
          would have two parts. The actual HTML form styled with CSS, and then
          some code running on a server that the form data would get sent to.
          The Server part is very important to building a <em>working</em> form,
          but is beyond the scope of this course. We will be focusing on the
          HTML and CSS part of building forms. Our form will not do much when
          submitted, and that's ok.
        </p>

            <h3>Functional Forms</h3>
            <p>
              Our form currently doesn't do anything (or maybe even gives you an
              error) if you submit it. If you would like it to do
              <em>something</em> we need to add a bit of code to your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before your form let's add an element to hold a success message
              when the form has been submitted. This element will be empty and
              invisible until the form is submitted...then we will use some
              Javascript to change it. Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element
              with an <kbd>id="feedback"</kbd> <strong>above</strong> your form
              element.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;div id="feedback"&gt;&lt/div&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>
              The exercise had you create a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element
              to hold the styling it wanted for the form. Add the following CSS
              to that below the other styles.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">#feedback {
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    padding: .5em;
    /* make this element invisible until we are ready for it */
    display: none;
        
}
.moveDown {
    margin-top: 3em;
}
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
              Finally <strong>below</strong> your form element add the following
              code:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;script&gt;
    // get the feedback div element so we can do something with it.
    const feedbackElement = document.getElementById('feedback');
    // get the form so we can read what was entered in it.
    const formElement = document.forms[0];
    // add a 'listener' to wait for a submission of our form. When that happens run the code below.
    formElement.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        // stop the form from doing the default action
        e.preventDefault();
        // set the contents of our feedback element to a message letting the user know the form was submitted successfully. Notice that we pull the name that was entered in the form to personalize the message!
        feedbackElement.innerHTML = 'Hello '+ formElement.user_name.value +'! Thank you for your message. We will get back with you as soon as possible!';
        // make the feedback element visible.
        feedbackElement.style.display = "block";
        // add a class to move everything down so our message doesn't cover it.
        document.body.classList.toggle('moveDown');
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
              If everything is working correctly you should see a message appear
              at the top of the form upon submission.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                The code above is something we have not seen before. It is
                Javascript. I added lots of comments if you want to try and
                understand what is going on. Javascript can be used to make our
                page more interactive, to change based on user actions, but is
                quite different from HTML and CSS. Don't worry if it doesn't
                make sense. The purpose of this class is not to teach
                Javascript, but I wanted to give you a small introduction...and
                forms are more fun if they <em>do</em> something!

              We have just scratched the surface with forms. The next two steps
              in the MDN tutorial are also great and will teach you much more
              about the details of working with forms. You do not have to
              complete them, but spend some time reviewing the form elements
              they introduce.
