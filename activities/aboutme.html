          This week we have two important goals. One to introduce you to HTML,
          and two to introduce you to each other. With this activity we will
          accomplish both.

            <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
            <p>
              Let's learn the vocabulary you will need to succeed in this
              course.

            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                HTML has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is
                important that we become familiar with it. Spend a few minutes
                familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a
                hard time making sense of the instruction given in this course
                if you don't understand these terms.
              </p>
              <dl class="def-list">
                <dt><strong>Tag</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  HTML tags are key words surrounded by angle brackets: ie&nbsp;
                  <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;body&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Element</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag,
                  with the content inserted in between:
                  <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Nesting</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  Elements placed inside of other elements are called nested.
                  Nested Elements are indented to make it easier to see which
                  elements are inside of others. Well formatted code (good
                  nesting) makes it easier for the developer to read their code,
                  maintain it and troubleshoot it.
                  <pre><code class="language-markup html">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Parent</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  In nesting the parent is the element that contains other
                  elements.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Child</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  In nesting a child element is contained&nbsp;
                  <em>inside</em>&nbsp;of another element
                  <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;div&gt;  &lt;-- Parent --&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;-- Child --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Attribute</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
                  They are placed inside of the opening tag. The value of the
                  attribute should be wrapped in quotes. ie
                  <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;p title="A paragraph about where I am from" &gt;Idaho&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Semantics</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in
                  a language. Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
                  Writing semantic HTML means using the html tag that best
                  describes the content you are adding to your page.

                I do not expect you to memorize all of the tags, etc in these
                links at this point. The goal is to familiarize yourself with
                the concepts and learn to recognize instances of the terms
                above. The site that these link to is also a great resource for
                learning/reviewing HTML and CSS concepts in general.

              Let's write some HTML. Open (log into) Glitch, and create a new

              to be exactly <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd>. No caps, no spaces.) Click
              on the <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> file to open it in the editor and
              remove all of the contents. Then type the HTML below.

              This code contains everything you need for a basic web page. It
              has most of the items listed above. Tags, elements, nesting,
              parent elements, child elements, and semantics. Can you spot them
              all?

                with the code examples. You will find that your ability to write

            <h2>Titles and Headlines</h2>
            <p>
              A visitor to a website should not have to guess what the page is
              about. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> says "All About Me".
              Although you can see "All About Me" looking at the html, it will
              not show up on the page.&nbsp; This is because
              <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is in the
              <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section and anything in the
              <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is not seen in the browser window. Only
              items in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section are actually seen
              on the page. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> shows up as the name
              of the tab or window.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can use a headline element on our page so that when someone
              visits your page, they will know what your page is about.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                There are various sizes of headlines: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> -
                <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> These can be used to establish a
                hierarchy for your page. The <em>smaller</em> the number with
                the h like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for instance, the
                <em>larger</em> the text and the more important the headline
                should be. An <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for example should be used
                for the <em>most important</em> title on the page. You should
                only use one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> on your page.
              </p>
              <p>
                <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags would be the next level and you can
                use as many as you need. Think about the structure of this
                course. It is broken up into weeks and activities. An outline
                using headline elements would look like the following:
              </p>
              <div class="outline">
                <h1>WDD 100 (&lt;h1&gt;)</h1>
                <h2>Week1 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                <h3>Software Setup (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h3>Getting to Know you (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h3>Purpose and Audience (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h2>Week2 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                <h3>Site Plan (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h3>Getting Started (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h2>Week3 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                ...
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              To let&nbsp;visitors to your page know what it is about at a
              glance, let's add a larger headline to advertise.&nbsp;Let's use
              the&nbsp; <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag for this. Add a line
              between the&nbsp; <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
              <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements and add an&nbsp;
              <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>opening tag,&nbsp;and type "About
              Me".&nbsp; Then enter&nbsp; <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;to close
              the element. Let's add a sub-heading or two as well.&nbsp; Let's
              use &lt;h2&gt; (smaller text) and put your first name and your
              nickname if you have one.&nbsp; Do this right after the
              <code>&lt;h1&gt; About Me&lt;/h1&gt;</code>:
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>Now your code should look like this:</p>
              <pre><code class="language-markup line-numbers html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;All About Me&lt;/title&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            <p>
              Next, let's write a few paragraphs to tell little bit about
              yourself. Here is a list of ideas to talk about to get you

                  How long have you been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ
                  of Latter Day Saints?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite quote from
                  one of the leaders of the church?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite
                  scripture?
                </li>
                <li>Anything else you may want to share.</li>

              Start with the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) that says "Hello
              World".&nbsp; Replace that with your own information and wording.
              Each time you want a new paragraph (please break it into more than
              one paragraph!) Add a new
              <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> element.
            </p>

            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>View your work</h2>
            <p>
              When you have finished adding your paragraphs you will want to
              view your webpage. To do this click on the "Show" button at the
              top left of the screen. Glitch offers two ways to view your
              webpage: In a new window and Next to the code. Before you turn in
              your work you should always check out your page in a new window,
              but most students prefer working "next to the code" while
              completing the assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Select the "Next to the code" option under show. You will notice
              that while we are working on the <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> file,
              Glitch opened the <strong> <kbd>index.html</kbd> </strong> file.
              You can use the link in the <kbd>index.html</kbd> page to switch
              pages, but everytime you make a change to the html Glitch will
              switch back to index! Let's tell it to always show us the
              <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> instead. Tap on the "Change URL" button in
              the pane that shows your webpage. In the box type
              <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd>. Now everytime Glitch refreshes the page
              it will stay on the page we are currently working on!

            <h2>Add an image</h2>
            <p>
              Look's good, but it is a little plain.&nbsp;Let's add an image to
              dress up your page.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before you can put an image on your web page, you have to get it
              onto a web server. Lucky for us Glitch makes this easy. We simply
              need to upload the image from your computer to your project in
              Glitch. To do this simply click on the <kbd>assets</kbd> link in
              Glitch. Then drag the image file onto the browser window where you
              have Glitch open. To use the image on our page we need the
              <strong>path</strong> to the image. Often this can be as simple as
              the name of the image. Because of the way Glitch stores images
              however we will need a bit of help. After uploading your image you
              should see it in the browser. Click on it, then click on "Copy
              Url". We are now ready to use it in an
              <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
            </p>

            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Glitch adding images"
                  src="../images/glitch-upload-img.jpg"
                  title="Glitch adding images"
                />
                <figcaption>Upload an Image</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Glitch image details"
                  src="../images/glitch-img-url.jpg"
                  title="Glitch image details"
                />
                <figcaption>Image URL</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>

            <p>
              Put your image right after the &lt;h1&gt; line. You will start
              with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Images require additional
              information in order to work however. We have to tell the browser
              where to find the image. We can use an "attribute" for this.
              (Remember <strong>attribute</strong> was one of the vocabulary
              above. If you have forgotten what it is go review). The attribute
              we need is <kbd>src=""</kbd>. Add this right after the word
              <kbd>img</kbd>. So it will look like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src=""&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Paste the name of your image into the "" after the
              <code>src</code>. The final tag should look something like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-markup html">&lt;img alt="Image of me?" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e7d21069-86b1-4294-9067-59ab154d710e%2FIMG_5684.jpg?1545880129047"  /&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Notice that I included an extra attribute:
              <strong> <kbd>alt</kbd> </strong>. The <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute
              should contain a short description of the image. It is shown if
              the browser can't find the image or it is read for visually
              impaired visitors to your site. <strong>All</strong> of your
              images should have an <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute. If a tag has
              multiple attributes, the order of the attributes does not matter.
            </p>

            <p>
              There, that looks great.... you coded a web page about yourself
              that is simple, informative, and has a touch of style.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your final page should look something like the pages below but
              with your information and your actual image.
            </p>
